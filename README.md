# Odin Recipes

This is a basic HTML project created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations curriculum. The goal of this project is to practice the fundamental concepts of HTML including:

- Creating and linking multiple pages
- Structuring content using semantic HTML elements
- Using lists, images, and links
- Understanding file structure and relative paths

By the end of this project, I will have a solid understanding of HTML structure and how to build a simple multi-page website.

## Skills demonstrated:
- Git & GitHub workflow (cloning, committing, pushing)
- Writing semantic HTML
- Working with local development environments
